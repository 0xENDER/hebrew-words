## Notes

I currently have no plans to add across-devices sync or mobile compatibility! I am tight on time and need to use this tool :>

You are free to fork this project and improve on it!

> I am not watching out for any of the following: mobile compatibility, cross-platform/cross-browser support, web optomisations, live IndexedDB updates (not watch IndexedDB for other-tab updates or similar things)
