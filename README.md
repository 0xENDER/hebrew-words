# Hebrew Words

This is a tool that can help you memorise the most frequantly used words in Hebrew!

## To-Do

- [ ] Add custom context menu pop-up
    - [ ] Add filtering
    - [ ] Add an export/import option
    - [ ] Add a reset option
    - [ ] Add the option to add a word individually
- [ ] Add a custom pop-up for option status selection

## Notes

I currently have no plans to add across-devices sync or mobile compatibility! I am tight on time and need to use this tool :>

You are free to fork this project and improve on it!
